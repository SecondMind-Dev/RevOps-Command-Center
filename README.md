# RevOps-Command-Center
Polished FastAPI + Next.js lab that mocks a multi-CRM rescue. Spins up   a fake HubSpot/Salesforce/Pipedrive ingest, normalizes everything into   a scoring engine, and renders a cinematic dashboard with Playwright-   tested snapshots. Includes automation logs, async digests, and mission   artifacts so other agents can replay the story.
